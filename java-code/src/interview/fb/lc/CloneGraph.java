/**
 * #133. Clone Graph
 * Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.
 * OJ's undirected graph serialization:
 * Nodes are labeled uniquely.
 * We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
 * As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.
 * The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.
 * First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
 * Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
 * Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
 * Visually, the graph looks like the following:
 *      1
 *     / \
 *    /   \
 *   0 --- 2
 *        / \
 *        \_/

    // A depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing a finite graph. DFS visits the child vertices before visiting the sibling vertices;
    // that is, it traverses the depth of any particular path before exploring its breadth. A stack (often the program's call stack via recursion)
    // is generally used when implementing the algorithm.
    // The algorithm begins with a chosen "root" vertex; it then iteratively transitions from the current vertex to an adjacent, unvisited vertex,
    // until it can no longer find an unexplored vertex to transition to from its current location. The algorithm then backtracks along previously
    // visited vertices, until it finds a vertex connected to yet more uncharted territory. It will then proceed down the new path as it had before,
    // backtracking as it encounters dead-ends, and ending only when the algorithm has backtracked past the original "root" vertex from the very first step.
    // DFS is the basis for many graph-related algorithms, including topological sorts and planarity testing.
    // Pseudocode:
    // Input: A graph G and a vertex v of G.
    // Output: A labeling of the edges in the connected component of v as discovery edges and back edges.
    //  procedure DFS(G, v):
    //      label v as explored
    //      for all edges e in G.incidentEdges(v) do
    //          if edge e is unexplored then
    //              w ‚Üê G.adjacentVertex(v, e)
    //              if vertex w is unexplored then
    //                  label e as a discovered edge
    //                  recursively call DFS(G, w)
    //              else
    //                  label e as a back edge
