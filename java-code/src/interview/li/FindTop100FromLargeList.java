// The description is quite general so maybe you can ask him the range or meaning of these numbers
// to make the problem clear. Doing this may impress an interviewer. If, for example, these numbers
// stands for people's age of within a country (e.g. China),then it's a much easier problem.
// With a reasonable assumption that nobody alive is older than 200, you can use an int array of
// size 200(maybe 201) to count the number of people with the same age in just one iteration.
// Here the index means the age. After this it's a piece of cake to find 100 largest number.
// By the way this algo is called counting sort.
