/**
 * 232. Implement Queue using Stacks
 * Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
 *  push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
 *  pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
 *  peek() -- Get the front element.
 *  empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
 *  Notes:
 *  You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size,
 *  and is empty operations are valid.
 *  Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list
 *  or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
 *  You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
